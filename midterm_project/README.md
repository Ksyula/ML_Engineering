# Fraud Detection end-to-end Machine Learning Project

The goal of the project is to build a fraud detection API that can be called to predict whether or not a transaction is fraudulent. 

The project follows an open standard guide CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), which describes the main phases of data mining lifecycle and widly used by data mining experts.
